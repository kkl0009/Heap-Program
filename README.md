# Heap-Program
This is a pretty basic program I wrote to explain heaps to a friend of mine. It is written in C, and uses a custom Node type. 

It supports the ability to add nodes to the heap, and to display the nodes of the heap in inorder, preorder, or postorder

It also allows users to completely reset the heap to an empty heap, however deleting individual nodes has not yet been implemented
